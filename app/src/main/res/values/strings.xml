    <string name="wolomin_info">The main town of Wołomin County in the Masovian Voivodship. A suburb
        of Warsaw situated 20 km from the capital of Poland, near the railway to Białystok.
        \n\nIt has approximately 37,000 inhabitants and covers an area of 17 sq km (6 sq mi).</string>
    <string name="history_text">Wołomin was first mentioned in chronicles from the 15th century.
        It remained a small village in central Masovia without much significance. Since 19th century,
        and especially after the foundation of the railway in 1862, Wołomin became a summer holiday
        destination for Warsaw citizens. The Wołomin glassworks were founded in the beginning of the 20th century.
        \n \nWołomin was declared a town in 1919 after the return of Poland\'s sovereignty.
        In 1920 the Polish counter-attack in the Battle of Warsaw was conducted near Wołomin.
        In the interbellum Wołomin retained its status as a multinational town. There was a big
        Jewish and Russian minority. Polish writer Zofia Nałkowska had a house in Wołomin, which
        became an inspiration for her 1925 book House over meadows (Polish: Dom nad łąkami).
        \n \nDuring World War II, the Jews of Wołomin were forced into a ghetto set up by Nazi
        German administration on 15 November 1940, along the railway line between the streets of
        Kobyłkowska, Wspólna, Wiejska, Glinka and Cementowa. The ghetto inmates numbered about 2,700
        people including Jews expelled from other locations. The Judenrat was established in the
        building at 17 Nałkowskiego Street. Deportations aboard Holocaust trains to Treblinka
        extermination camp began on 19 August 1942. The ghetto was liquidated on 6 October 1942.
        A few hundred people (416-620 according to different sources) were shot in the ghetto,
        including many elderly and sick people. Their bodies were buried in a mass grave near the
        Korsaka Road. Some Jews were deported to the Warsaw Ghetto as slave labour and exterminated
        during the Grossaktion Warsaw.
        \n \nAfter the war, Wołomin became a capital of the powiat of Wołomin and started to grow
        rapidly. The window assembly plant was founded and Wołomin soon became a suburb of Warsaw.
        Even today most of the town\'s inhabitants commute to Warsaw on a daily basis.</string>
